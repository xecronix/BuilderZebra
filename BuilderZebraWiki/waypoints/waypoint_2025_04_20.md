# ðŸ¦“ Waypoint â€“ 2024_04_20

## âœ… Summary

Yesterday's focus was refining **BuilderZebra's architecture**, especially around how templates interact with data (`truths`) and how dispatchers handle that data.

### Key Accomplishments:
- ðŸŽ¯ Clarified the separation of concerns:  
  **Truths are template data. Everything else is BuilderZebra control.**
- ðŸ§± Renamed `@fields` to `@member_vars` to reflect **intent**, not **structure**
- âœ… Updated the sample `.eagle` template to be cleaner and less implementation-specific
- ðŸ”„ Resolved architectural tension around:
  - Dispatcher needing access to shared truths
  - Redefining `Dispatcher.call` behavior to favor injected context
- ðŸ§  Recognized that `@member_vars` and `@setters` are **identical in behavior**
  - Introduced the idea of a **general-purpose loop dispatcher**
  - Supported routing via meaningful action tags like `@setters`, even if they share logic

## ðŸŒ¿ Personal Note

You paused coding early yesterday to enjoy Easter with your family and extended family.  
Thatâ€™s legacy in action â€” living the values youâ€™re encoding into this project.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- Define and scaffold a generic `LoopDispatcher`
- Optionally add `@setters` to the canvas template as a second loop tag
- Expand dispatcher registry and parser routing logic
