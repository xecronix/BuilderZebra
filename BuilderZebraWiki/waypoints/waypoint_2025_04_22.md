## ‚úÖ Project Snapshot
BuilderZebra has reached a strong MVP state with support for structured project scaffolds, validation, and file generation.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Features Completed
- **Three project modes:** `init`, `validate`, and default `build`
- **Environment-based scaffolding:**
  - Uses `BUILDER_ZEBRA_HOME` to load scaffolds from `project_scaffolds/<template>`
  - Recursively copies all files (including `eagles/` subfolder) to local `./zebra/`
- **Dynamic file rendering:**
  - Uses templates defined in `zebra/scaffold.json`
  - Loads data from `zebra/truths.json`
  - Uses `ZebraTruthBinder` to resolve truth context
- **File output behavior:**
  - Respects `outputFilePattern` and replaces `%{truth.name}`
  - Honors per-output `overWrite` flags (`"never"` skips writing if file exists)
  - Logs all written or skipped files to stdout
- **Validation mode:**
  - Fully parses templates with actual truth context
  - Displays rendered results for each truth/template pair
  - Catches missing templates or truth mismatches with clean messages

## üîß Recent Fixes
- `runInit()` no longer uses `stdin` (which caused hangs)
- Template paths are now relative to `zebra/eagles/`
- `Directory.create()` is safely called with `recursive: true` only
- Removed all `_defaultJson()` functions in favor of true scaffolds

---

## üß† Notable Design Choices
- Renamed `outputs` to `scaffold` for semantic clarity
- `ZebraTruthBinder` now fully abstracts project-bound truth loading
- File path resolution uses `package:path` to avoid platform-specific bugs

---

## üìå Next Steps (Optional)
- Add `builder_zebra list` to show available scaffolds
- Add default fallback if no scaffold name is provided
- Expose validation report as JSON or log file
- Enable global `overwrite` override from zebra.json
