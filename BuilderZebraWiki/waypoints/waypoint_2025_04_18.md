## 🧭 Waypoint – 2025-04-16 Evening Wrap-Up

**Milestone:** Builder tools ready — Zebra ecosystem is now self-building.  
**Focus:** Finalized `MightyEagleParser`, introduced `zebra_validate`, and built `zebra_make`.

---

### ✅ Completed Today

- 🎯 Finalized error and message hook for `MightyEagleParser`
  - Added reverse-stream logic to locate unclosed tags
  - Hook now reports contextual error messages, warnings, and preview
  - Parser tattles automatically unless redirected
- 🛠️ Built CLI validator: `zebra_validate.dart`
  - Supports `-f`, `-d`, `-o`, `-O`, and `-h` options
  - Runs parser without substitutions
  - Sends output to stdout, stderr, and/or file
- ⚙️ Created `zebra_make.dart`
  - Compiles a hardcoded list of Dart tools to `.exe`
  - Automatically resolves `dart.bat` on Windows (via `where`)
  - Avoids compiling itself (bootstrapping hazard)
  - Works seamlessly from both `dart run` and `.exe`
- 📂 Established template and data file types
  - `.eagle` for templates (parsed by MightyEagle)
  - `.zebra` for BuilderZebra schema/truth files

### 🔭 Observations Captured
- tattle is already handled by `parser.parse()`, avoid calling it redundantly
- Building yourself (i.e. `zebra_make`) from within yourself is not allowed — use `dart run` instead
- Clear documentation and CLI usability are first-class citizens in this ecosystem
