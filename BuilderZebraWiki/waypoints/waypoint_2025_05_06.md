# 🦓 BuilderZebra – Victory Lap: Conditional Dispatchers Complete  
**Date:** 2025-05-06

## ✅ Completed
- Replaced legacy `^if` and `^each` with clean, scoped dispatcher logic
- Implemented full conditional branching model:
  - `if` (pushes to stack)
  - `elseif` (pushes to stack)
  - `else` (pushes without condition)
  - `endif` (resolves branches in reverse order)
- Added full test coverage (if, elseif, else, fallback)
- Cleaned up old code:
  - Deleted `each_preserve_space_dispatcher.dart`
  - Retired legacy `^` dispatchers
- Refactored `if` to push raw condition, letting `endif` own resolution
- Mighty Eagle remains unmodified in control logic
- Binder now supports stack push, pop, peek, and dump

## 🔍 Notable Insight
> "Truth flows forward. But resolution walks backward."

Resolution strategy now honors reverse condition matching to align with `if/elseif/else` semantics.

## 🎯 Next
- Possibly test nested `if` blocks or begin loop/switch scaffolding
- Revisit exception strategy for malformed dispatcher tags (e.g. bad `{@else|...}` usage)

All 39 tests passing. Stack returns to zero. Truth engine is stable.
