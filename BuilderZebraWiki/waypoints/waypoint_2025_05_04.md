## 🦓 BuilderZebra Expanded with Powerful Modular Features

### ✅ New Dispatchers
- **LineDispatcher** – Flattens output, removes all newlines and squashes whitespace
- **TightDispatcher** – Preserves line breaks but normalizes intra-line spacing
- **ChickDispatcher** – Supports modular fragment injection from `zebra/chicks/`

### 🔁 Co-Managed Templates Introduced
- Allows injecting logic into pre-existing files outside the `zebra/generated/` tree
- Respects developer-owned structure and enables future partial regeneration
- All powered by truth-bound parsing without core disruption

### 🛠️ Minor Fixes
- Patched whitespace bug in newline handling
- Refactored line/tight normalization logic for clarity and reliability

### 📚 Supporting Updates
- Added full tests for `line`, `tight`, and `chick`
- Updated dispatcher factory with new mappings
- Preserved compatibility with legacy dispatcher syntax
- Adjusted `builder_zebra.dart` to resolve templates from both `eagles/` and raw file paths

### 🧠 Architecture Notes
- Parser remained untouched
- All changes modular, opt-in, and backward-compatible
- Dispatchers now fully own behavioral responsibility
