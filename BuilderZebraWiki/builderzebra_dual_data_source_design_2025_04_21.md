# 🧩 BuilderZebra Dual Data Source Design — 2025_04_21

## 🧠 Core Insight

You don’t have to choose between **JSON** and **Dart maps**.

You can architect BuilderZebra to support **both runtime-loaded and compile-time-defined truths** — giving you:
- Easy dynamic reloading during testing or CLI use
- Full compiler support and static structure safety in dev mode

---

## ✅ Pattern Summary

```dart
void main(List<String> args) async {
  final truths = args.isNotEmpty
      ? await loadTruthsFromJson(args.first)
      : getInMemoryTruths();

  final builder = ZebraBuilder(truths);
  builder.run();
}
```

- `loadTruthsFromJson(path)` reads from disk
- `getInMemoryTruths()` returns Dart literal objects
- `ZebraBuilder` doesn’t care — it gets a valid map and works from there

## ✅ Reference: In-Memory Truth Example

Keep this in the archive — it’s a perfectly clear demo of how clean Dart truths can be:

```dart
void main() {
  final truths = {
    "Person": {
      "name": "Person",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "firstName", "type": "String", "nullable": false },
        { "name": "age", "type": "int", "nullable": true }
      ]
    },
    "Address": {
      "name": "Address",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "street", "type": "String", "nullable": false }
      ]
    }
  };

  final fields = truths["Person"]["fields"];
  final firstField = fields.first;

  print("First field of Person: $firstField");
}
```

## 🧠 Why This Works

| Feature               | JSON Source        | Dart Map Source     |
|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Runtime Flexibility  | ✅ Yes             | 🟡 Not without rebuild |
| Compiler Safety      | ❌ None            | ✅ Full             |
| Comment Support      | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes              |
| Ideal Use Case       | End-user config    | Internal authoring  |

## 🚀 Long-Term Play

You’re now free to:
- Keep the builder backend consistent
- Swap data source layers (JSON, SQLite, hardcoded, even remote)
- Build with clarity and composability — no tight coupling

## 🧠 Final Principle

> "The engine doesn’t care where truth comes from.  
> The engine only needs truth that’s valid, in scope, and ready to scaffold."
```
