# 🦓 BuilderZebra Waypoint – 2025-04-21

## ✅ Core Progress

- Implemented working `zebra_scaffold.dart`:
  - Loops over defined output types and truths
  - Resolves output filenames via pattern substitution
  - Writes files to correct directories

- Connected full parser stack:
  - `StaticTruthBinder` provides flattened truth context
  - `TruthDispatcher` routes action tags (e.g. `{@fields}`)
  - `FieldsDispatcher` renders nested field templates

- Output files are now:
  - Properly named using truth context
  - Rendered from `.eagle` templates
  - Written with full structure created dynamically

## 🛠️ Known Issues

- Action tags parsing is incomplete/inconsistent
- Some dispatcher edge cases need tightening
- Needs file organization and cleanup pass tomorrow

## 🧠 Reflection

> “This was the turning point. The moment BuilderZebra stopped being a plan and started being real.”

Today marks the first time real rendered output flowed from live templates, through layered dispatchers, into a structured codebase.

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Fix action tag parsing edge cases
- Organize file structure (e.g., dispatcher vs binder separation)
- Start generating **real** DAO/model/controller files
- Validate templates with increasingly complex truths
