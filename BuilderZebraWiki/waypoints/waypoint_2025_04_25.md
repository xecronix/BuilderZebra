# ðŸ¦“ BuilderZebra â€“ Waypoint 2025-04-25

## âœ… Major Accomplishments
- Finished re-architecture of TruthDispatcher and DispatcherFactory system.
- Implemented IfDispatcher simplification (removed `$` prefix requirement for fields).
- Finalized scaffold.json configuration structure:
  - `truths` (optional whitelist)
  - `excludeTruths` (optional blacklist)
  - `overwrite` = "never" supported (no explicit "always" needed).
- Templates now fully dynamic:
  - `base_model.eagle` generates base classes in `generated/`.
  - `model_wrapper.eagle` generates human-editable wrapper classes in `lib/`.
- Implemented 2-for-1 file generation:
  - **Base + Wrapper** per truth automatically scaffolded.
- Full BuilderZebra pipeline operational:
  - `init`, `validate`, and `build` commands working.
  - Environment-driven (`BUILDER_ZEBRA_HOME`).
- All tests updated and **passing**.
- Updated working `builder_zebra.dart` core:
  - Truth whitelist/blacklist support added.
  - Output pattern resolving system confirmed.
- Wrote new full Wiki documentation for `scaffold.json`.
- Created matching quick cheat sheet for fast reference.

## ðŸ›  Improvements & Cleanups
- No more $ enforcement in conditional templates (`if` dispatcher).
- Aligned context rules across substitution, each, and if.
- Catch up on waypoint creation.
- Prepare for GitHub sync to bring full history up to date.

## ðŸš€ Next Major Targets
- Finalize PATH environment setup for production installs.
- Push final BuilderZebra v1 to GitHub.
- Optional polish: build a bootstrap `zebra.bat` or `zebra.sh`.
