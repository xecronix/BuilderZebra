**Milestone:**  
Refactored MightyEagleParser to use LL(1)-style parsing via `_CharStream`.

**What Changed:**
- Replaced manual character/index management with clean `CharStream` abstraction
- Updated state machine to leverage `.current` and `.next` lookahead
- Improved tag handling readability and structure (especially for escaping, substitution, and action tags)
- Successfully tested:
  - `{=name:}` substitution
  - `{@greeting ...:}` action with inner substitution
- Planning follow-up tests for escape handling and dispatcher args
- Added private `CharStream` class for safe and extendable traversal

**Next:**  
Add more parser tests and eventually revisit visual flow or teaching docs.
