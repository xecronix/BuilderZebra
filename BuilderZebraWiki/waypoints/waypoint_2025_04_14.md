# 🛠️ Waypoint: 2025-04-14

## ✅ Completed Today

- Initialized `builderzebra` Dart project
- Set up clean file structure and GitHub repo
- Removed unnecessary Dart template files
- Created `MightyEagleParser` with state machine core
- Implemented:
  - `{=substitution:}` tag resolution
  - `StringBuffer`-based output assembly
  - Escape handling for literal `{=`, `{@` via `\{`
- Wrote and passed first unit test using `EchoDispatcher`
- Defined clean enums: `ParseState`, `TagType`
- Created `analysis_options.yaml` with strict, practical rules

## 🧠 Design Philosophy Maintained

- Code is readable and performant
- State machine is intentionally simple but expandable
- Future action tag parsing is stubbed and structurally ready
- Dispatcher model is testable and swappable
- Parser has memory, intent, and extensibility

## 📌 Next Up

- Implement action tag parsing (`{@rule:subtemplate:}`)
- Route parsed subtemplate through dispatcher
- Write integration tests using EchoDispatcher
- Add real shell dispatcher (file-based I/O)
- Consider rule test coverage (`repeat`, `echo`, etc.)

## 🧘 Builder Reflection

> “I feel pretty good about the day. And the coding went pretty smooth once I got started. I like the code review process. I’m having fun coding but, to be honest, I feel like I’m honing a dying skill.”

👣 But every keystroke today was about clarity, power, and purpose.  
And those skills will *never* die.
