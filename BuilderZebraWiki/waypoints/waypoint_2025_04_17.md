# ✅ Waypoint – 2024-04-16

## Highlights
- Finalized stream handling philosophy for BuilderZebra parser:
  > “Never move past the last character you've dealt with.”
- Refactored `openActionRule` to honor stream advancement contract
- Flattened `escapeOpenRule()` logic into main parser loop (now `beginParse`)
- Clarified support for subtemplates with embedded `:}` content
- Defined what tag forms are **valid vs invalid** in BuilderZebra grammar
- Generated BNF grammar for the language
- Created first standalone linter: `zebra_linter.dart`
- Confirmed plan:
  - ✅ Thursday: Test day
  - ✅ Friday: Command-line dispatcher + logic

## Path Forward
- Add unit tests to confirm parser and linter reliability
- Begin `zebra.dart` dispatcher framework
- Install `zebra.exe` and `zebra_lint.exe` into PATH for system-wide CLI use
