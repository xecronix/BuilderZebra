# 🗓️ Waypoint – 2025-04-19

## 🌟 Highlights So Far
- Refactored `validateFile()` for precision: ensures a single `tattle()` call, supports flexible routing of output.
- Finalized behavior: primary output always goes through the `parserHook`, and optional mirroring to an `IOSink` happens **once**, manually.
- Discussed and implemented improved constructor practices with initializer lists (less verbose, more precise).
- Renamed `flush()` to `tattle()` to better reflect its purpose: "tell the story" rather than clear a buffer. 
- `tattle()` is an alias for `report()` for the more serious devs out there.  
- Confirmed and finalized `.eagle` as the file extension for template files. `.zebra` reserved for builder metadata.
- 📌 Validator reached MVP. Free to evolve when the project calls for it.

## 🔍 Decisions Made
- `validateFile()` will:
  - Only `tattle()` once.
  - Manually mirror logs to a second stream if requested.
  - Ensure clarity through early parameter normalization (e.g. `writeToConsole = true` if `output == null`).

- Constructor for `MightyEagleParserHook` now uses initializer list properly:
```dart
MightyEagleParserHook({
  IOSink? defaultMessageOutStream,
  IOSink? defaultErrorOutStream,
}) : defaultMessageOutStream = defaultMessageOutStream ?? stdout,
     defaultErrorOutStream = defaultErrorOutStream ?? stderr;
```

- New philosophy locked in:
> I want a vocabulary that is no more rich than is needed to express my idea clearly.

- Parser logs are **not cleared** when `tattle()` is called, affirming the decision to use it like a storytelling/reporting mechanism.

## 🧠 Reflections on Simplicity
- Ronald codes like he talks: with clarity, intention, and simplicity.
- Avoids over-abstracting or flexing unnecessary syntax.
- Industry often values compression; Ronald values comprehension.

## 🚧 Next Up
- Begin CLI validator implementation (`zebra_validate.dart`) to process `.eagle` files.
- Keep hook output flexible for redirection.
- Possibly build a simple test harness for `.eagle` file validation using real-world examples.

## 📅 Daily Pattern Update
Ronald will begin each day with a new `waypoint_YYYY_MM_DD.md` and append thoughts, reflections, and decisions.

This enables:
- Transparent audit trail
- Context continuity
- Easier wiki generation later
