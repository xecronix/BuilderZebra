### âœ… Completed
- Full refactor and validation of `MightyEagleParser`
  - Clean error handling via `TemplateParseException`
  - Fully stream-aware, linear parsing with nesting and dispatcher logic
- Finalized and tested `MightyEagleParserHook`
  - Reverse-walking nesting error detection
  - `aggregateErrors`, `aggregateMessages`, `flush()`
  - CLI-ready and testable
- `.zebra` chosen as the official file extension for BuilderZebra templates

### ðŸš€ Up Next
- Build CLI validator: `zebra_validate.dart`
  - Accept file paths or folders
  - Run MightyEagle in validation mode
  - Print diagnostics using the hook system
- Begin scaffolding `BuilderZebra` core runtime
  - Dispatcher rule system
